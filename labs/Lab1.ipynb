    "In this lab you will create an inverted index for the Gutenberg books. What I want you to do is create a single index that you can quickly return all the lines from all the books that contain a specific word. We will be using the basic and naive split functionality from the chapter (i.e., don't worry about punctuation, etc). Those are details that are not necessary for our exploration into distributed computing. We will use GNU Parallel to distributed our solution."
